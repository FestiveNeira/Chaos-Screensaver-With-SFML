# Chaos-Screensaver-With-SFML
 
Requires SFML 2.5.1 to use in Visual Studio.

If you'd like to use the code or modify the program you can get SFML here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/

Once it's downloaded you need to make sure the project is properly referencing its location, by default the project will reference C:\Program Files\SFML-2.5.1 as that's where I have mine installed, for simpliciity sake if you've never used SFML I recommend placing your SFML-2.5.1 folder in your C:\Program Files folder so you don't have to edit the project settings.
